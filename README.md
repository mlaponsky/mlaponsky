ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max Laponsky, a data scientist and software developer based out of Washington DC. My particular focus is on NLP applications,
but I also enjoy analytics integration. In my non-coding time, I spend most of my time on basketball, video games and music - particularly playing the drums.

If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me [an email](mailto:thebiglaponsky@gmail.com).
